A cybersecurity auditing tool designed for the **Post-Quantum transition**. 

## Objectives:
- **NIST FIPS 203/204 Compliance:** Detects support for ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium).
- **Hybrid Analysis:** Identifies if endpoints support the transition-phase Hybrid Key Exchanges (X25519 + ML-KEM).
- **Crypto-Agility Scoring:** Grades servers based on their readiness for Y2Q (Year to Quantum).
